# My Porfolio - A Developer's Porfolio
Legal & Copyright statements

# Project Objective
This project is to create an employee's porfolio page template (a website) that meets the content and UX requirements, with the mock-up provided as a baseline.  

# Design Requirements
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application

- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

4. As shown in the image from 3, if saved successfully, GitHub will return a live site URL:
https://htang2021.github.io/htang-porfolio/

If you do not see a clear indication that the site is "published", give it a minute for the backend to allocate resources to launch it.  Once you see "Your site is published at https://....", it's golden!
